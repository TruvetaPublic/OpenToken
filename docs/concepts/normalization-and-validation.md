# Normalization and Validation

One-sentence description: Summarize how person attributes are validated and normalized before token generation.

## TODO
- Document validation rules for names, birthdate, postal code, sex, and SSN.
- Explain normalization steps (case, diacritics, padding, suffix/title removal).
- Provide accepted input formats and rejected placeholder values.
- Add examples showing raw input vs normalized output.
