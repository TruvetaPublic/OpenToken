# Core opentoken dependency
opentoken==1.12.1

# Cryptography for token decryption in overlap analysis
pycryptodome>=3.18.0

# Spark-related dependencies (pyspark, pandas, pyarrow) are intentionally
# not pinned here. Please install opentoken-pyspark with the appropriate
# extras for your Spark environment, for example:
#   pip install "opentoken-pyspark[spark40]"  # Spark 4.0+ (Java 21, requires pandas 2.0+)
#   pip install "opentoken-pyspark[spark35]"  # Spark 3.5.x (Java 8-17)
#   pip install "opentoken-pyspark[spark34]"  # Spark 3.4.x (legacy)
# This avoids requirements.txt forcing a specific Spark version and keeps
# behavior aligned with setup.py extras_require.
