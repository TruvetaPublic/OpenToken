## Editing guidance

- Prefer reusable setup from [`../actions/`](../actions/README.md) instead of duplicating toolchain setup in every workflow.
- Treat lock/generated agentic workflow outputs carefully; edit the source definition when possible.
- Review permissions, triggers, and branch targeting whenever you change a workflow.
- Keep workflow behavior aligned with repo standards from [`../instructions/`](../instructions/README.md).
