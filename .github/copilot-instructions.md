We use Java for our development, and we follow the Java coding conventions. Please ensure that your code adheres to the following guidelines:
We use JUnit for unit testing. Please write unit tests for any new features or bug fixes you implement.
We use Maven for dependency management and project structure. Ensure that your code is compatible with Maven.

Before creating a pull request, please run `mvn clean install` and then run a local execution like the example from the README file to ensure that everything works as expected.

When a version bump is needed, please run `bump2version`.

Ensure that your code is well-documented, including method-level comments and class-level documentation where necessary.
Ensure the README.md is kept up to date with any new features or changes you make.
